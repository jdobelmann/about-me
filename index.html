	<h2>Background</h2>
	I am originally from Old Monroe, MO, but have lived in Colorado, Wyoming, South Carolina, and Iowa throughout my life. I earned my Associate's degree from Laramie County Community College in Cheyenne, Wyoming. My hobbies include playing video games and studying martial arts.

	<h2>Plans</h2>
	Once I complete my undergraduate degree, I will move to Colorado or Nebraska and find a job. I would like to get a programming job but would not mind working in IT administration. Eventually, I would like to create a video game, but I would probably do that as more of a hobby as opposed to a career.
