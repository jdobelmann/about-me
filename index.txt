My name is Joseph Dobelmann. I am in section 02 with Dr. Case.

I am currently studying Information Technology. This is the last semester of my Bachelor of Applied Science degree. I began college in 2016 and transferred to Northwest last fall.

I am originally from Old Monroe, MO, but have lived in Colorado, Wyoming, South Carolina, and Iowa throughout my life. I earned my Associate's degree from Laramie County Community College in Cheyenne, Wyoming. My hobbies include playing video games and studying martial arts.

Once I complete my undergraduate degree, I will either pursue a graduate degree in Computer Science or move to Fort Collins, CO, and find a job. I would like to get a programming job but would not mind working in IT administration. Eventually, I would like to create a video game, but I would probably do that as more of a hobby as opposed to a career.

An interesting fact about me is that I have a brown belt in Kenpo. My github can be found at https://github.com/jdobelmann (Links to an external site.) (I do not have a LinkedIn or a BitBucket).
